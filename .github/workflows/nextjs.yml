  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events for the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "test"
  test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a specific version of Node.js
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          # Caches the npm dependency cache for faster installs
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Installs project dependencies using npm ci for a clean, reliable install
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Runs the linter to check for code quality issues.
      # The `--if-present` flag makes this step optional if you don't have a "lint" script.
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint --if-present

      # Step 5: Runs the test suite.
      # The `--if-present` flag makes this step optional if you don't have a "test" script.
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test --if-present
        
      # Step 6: Creates a production build of the application to ensure it builds successfully
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
